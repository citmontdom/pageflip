            <td>CORALINE - 5/5 - With this book, you simply cannot go wrong! If you like a scary, thrilling book that isn't flat out adult horror, this is the one! The story's message will definitely leave you thinking.</td>
            <td>DORK DIARIES : TALES FROM A NOT-SO-FABULOUS LIFE - 5/5 I read this series when I was in middle school and I absolutely loved it. If you're into Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and other diary-style, graphic novels, then I'm sure you will like this teen drama series!</td>
            <td>DOUBLE IDENTITY - 5/5 - For the psychological fans, this is for you! I always wondered if human cloning was possible. This book will show you just what cloning would be like. It's great for all ages too!</td>
            <td>JUNIE B. JONES AND THE STUPID SMELLY BUS - 5/5 - If you're looking for a children's book, this is a great start. My sister and I both read this series when we were in elementary school. Junie B Jones is quite a character and does a great job of showing realistic kid behavior.</td>

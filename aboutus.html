      <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Citlalli Montiel, I am the creator if Page Flip. When I was in elementary, our class trips to the school library were always my favorite. I was blessed enough that my school had a large selection of books, and I definitely took advantage of that! On the weekends I would make my mom take me to the Seattle Public Library to check out some books and read them all summer long! But the best part about going to the library was always the feedback the librarians would give me on my selected books. They would let me know if I had made the right choice, and often times they would recommend me something else. I enjoyed this interaction because I got to hear the emotions that the same book I was going to read had made somebody else feel.</p>
		<p>I hope to keep growing my website and with it, bring on new additions to the team! There's lots of great readers and reviewers out there and I just need to find them :) If you are interested in joining the team, be sure to leave me a message in the Contact Us page. I'd love to connect!</p>
